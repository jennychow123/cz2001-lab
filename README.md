## Pull Request, additions, changes to code, etc

**Notice to collaborators performing edits on the project.**

All local development and changes to the master copy should be done in
appropriately named branches

Do not merge your changes directly into your local master branch and push to Git
unless you know what you are doing!!!

If you are done developing the component you are working on, push your
branch to GitHub by doing:

`git push -u origin <branch_name>`

After that, visit the

[Git repository page](//github.com/sohjunjie/cz2001-lab/) and open a

pull request to the `master` branch.

Give your pull request a title and describe what you are trying to do
and self-review your code. Only merge to master if you are happy with 
your changes.
